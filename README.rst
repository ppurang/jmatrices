==================================

JMatrices is a matrix library in Java that grew from the inability of satisfactorily
using a different implementation of a matrix other than the one provided by the then available libraries and
the frustrations of the Matrix classes of th etime defining scores of methods in a single class file.

History
========
This library started as a project on the sourceforge originally licensed under LGPL (and as of this release still licensed under LGPL). 
A lot of code was borrowed from JAMA_.
The source was bundled with the releases. In 2009 the various episodes of work between 
2004 and 2005 were bundled and reorganized a final time into a Mercurial repo and recently made available on bitbucket_
At the same time a decision was made to release it on Github.

In 2011 the library underwent another reorganization to make it suitable for builds under the SBT_.

The web-pages can be found on jmatrices_ at sourceforge.
