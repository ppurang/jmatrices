==================================
jMatrices
==================================

JMarices is a matrix library in Java that grew from the inability of satisfactorily 
using different implementations of a matrix other than the one provided by the then available libraries and 
the frustrations of Matrix classes defining scores of methods in a single class file.

History
========
This library started as a project on the sourceforge originally licensed under LGPL (and as of this release still licensed under LGPL). 
A lot of code was borrowed from JAMA_.
The source was bundled with the releases. In 2009 the various episodes of work between 
2004 and 2009 were bundled into a Mercurial repo and recently made available on bitbucket_
At the same time a decision was made to release it on Github.

The web-pages can be found on jmatrices_ at sourceforge.
