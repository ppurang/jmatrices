<h2>org.jmatrices.dbl</h2>
This is the core of the library. The most important member of this
package  is the {@link org.jmatrices.dbl.Matrix} which defines the
contract that a Matrix object should fulfill.

This package also implements the infrastructural services required
to support different implementations via the
class {@link org.jmatrices.dbl.MatrixFactory}, interfaces
{@link org.jmatrices.dbl.MutableMatrixProducer} and
{@link org.jmatrices.dbl.MatrixSelectionStrategy}

This package also provides some implementation classes for example:

{@link org.jmatrices.dbl.MatrixSelectionStrategy#getArrayMatrix}
returns a two-dimensional-array based implementation of Matrix.

This package also provides abstract implementations that are suitable
for extension and provide contractural checks laid down by the Matrix
interface.
